'''
This plan is to help in the design of creating a report_generator.py
sNp files are expected to always be single ended, the option single/diff will convert


The scope of this portion is to establish a pipeline.
report_generator is a 2nd layer back-end built on top of
guide_manager. 

Given: 


'''

def read_info(self, path):
	'''
	read_info takes a path and reads info in as a dictionary self.info,  default location
	'''
	pass

def read_guide(self, path):
	'''
	read_guide takes a guide path and creates a self.gm instance and populates it with that guide, default location
	'''
	pass

def build_template(self, template_path, output_path):
	# read_template takes a path and reads it in to self.template,  default location
	# insert info and tables and plots into template
	# dump to output path
        pass


def create_report(self):
	'''
	takes in an info, template, and guide, all paths
	

	# read_info(path)
	# read_template(path)
	# read_guide(path)

	# gm.set_xy()
	# gm.gen_plots()

	# build_template(template_path, output_path)
